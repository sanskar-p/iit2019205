1.Web Development - I always find something wrong or dissapointing about websites and I always ask myself how hard can this be? I get a lot of random, creative ideas and making a website sounds pretty cool.

2.Cyber Security - I'm a big fan of the hackerman meme and those people look really cool in movies. Up until high school, I was super interested in math too. So stuff like encryption and code breaking really entices me.

3. FOSS - The whole idea of contributing to others' projects sounded really impressive to me when I first found out about it. I faced, and am facing, a LOT of difficulties in learning all this new tech stuff in college and I guess FOSS can help me with this.

4. Competitive Coding - Literally every senior stresses about it's importance and also, understanding algorithms is something I like and I hope that someday I'm actually able to come up with fool-proof algos.
